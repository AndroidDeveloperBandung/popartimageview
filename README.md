## Pop Art ImageView 

To make things more simpler, i already setup the project to two module. One for the library and one for the sample app (The application that we actually can run)

To start the workshop, please do follow: 

```
1. Clone from the master branch 
2. Open Android Studio -> Import project 
3. Sync gradle, clean if needed
``` 

## The Result
